This utility takes a square chunk of sky as a config. Any square will do.

Cuts it into 1x1 degree squares

Looks to see if there are any James Webb Space Telescope "fits" files available for download in that square from mast

If there are, it checks to see if they are the type that might be useful for looking for unidentified Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO)

If they could be useful it downloads them carefully

Fits files need a little clean 'n collate before they're ready to roll

Then we look for movement that matches what a KBO object would _move_ like, twinkle like, and at a distance they'd likely be at

Then we stare really hard at the pixels and squint at them, and jiggle them slightly, and scrunch our nose

If we see something, make a note of it

Look in all the catalogs because someone has almost definitely already seen it

If not.... ....
